**Article 1:** In this project, I designed a database for Costco, focusing on key business operations like managing members, products, orders, suppliers, employees, and transactions. The database includes well-organized tables such as Members, Orders, Products, Suppliers, Employees, and Transactions, with defined relationships like one-to-many (e.g., one member can place many orders) and many-to-many (e.g., orders and products through a junction table). The design enables Costco to track and manage various business activities, like monitoring inventory levels, processing orders, and managing supplier relationships, making the system scalable for future growth.
